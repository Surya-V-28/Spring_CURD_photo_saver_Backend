# Spring Boot JDBC CRUD Operations Example

This is a simple example demonstrating how to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Spring Boot with JDBC (Java Database Connectivity).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure that you have Java installed on your machine.

- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): You can use IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or your preferred IDE for Java development.

### Running the Application

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone this repo

   Open the project in your IDE.

2. Configure your database connection in the application.properties or application.yml file with your database URL, username, and password.

3. Build and run the Spring Boot application.

You can run it from your IDE, or

Use the command line:

4. bash
Copy code
./mvnw spring-boot:run
The application should start, and you can access the CRUD operations through RESTful endpoints.

#CRUD Operations
Create (POST)
To create a new record, send a POST request to the /employees endpoint with a JSON payload containing the employee data.

##Read (GET)
To retrieve all employees, send a GET request to the /employees endpoint.

To retrieve a specific employee by ID, send a GET request to /employees/{id}.

##Update (PUT)
To update an existing employee record, send a PUT request to /employees/{id} with a JSON payload containing the updated data.

##Delete (DELETE)
To delete an employee record, send a DELETE request to /employees/{id}.
